Spambayes Core
==============

This is a pruned down version of "spambayes", containing only the core parts.
Most importantly, it includes the classifier and tokenizer.  Code has been
converted to run with Python 3.  I have not done extensive testing and so the
code conversion may have introduced bugs.

The initial code was taken from Skip's github repo:
